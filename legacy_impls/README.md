# Legacy Implementations

⚠️ **This directory contains legacy open-source implementations that are no longer used.**

This directory contains the historical open-source implementations of the OpenWebF project components that were used until early 2025. These implementations have been moved here for reference purposes as **the WebF core development transitioned to closed-source in early 2025**.

## What is OpenWebF?

[OpenWebF](https://openwebf.com) is a high-performance web rendering engine built on top of Flutter that enables web applications to run natively within the Flutter ecosystem while adhering to W3C standards.

## Contents

- **`bridge/`** - Legacy open-source C++ bridge implementation between Flutter and web runtime
- **`integration_tests/`** - Historical integration test suites from the open-source era
- **`webf/`** - Legacy open-source Dart package implementation
- **`scripts/`** - Legacy build and utility scripts from the open-source implementation

## Transition to Closed Source

As of early 2025, WebF core development has transitioned to a closed-source model. These legacy implementations represent the final open-source version of the WebF engine and are preserved for:

- Historical reference and understanding of the original open-source architecture
- Educational purposes for learning about web engine implementation
- Reference for contributors who worked on the open-source version

## Usage Notice

**These legacy implementations are no longer maintained** and should not be used in production environments. They may contain outdated dependencies, security vulnerabilities, or incompatible APIs.
