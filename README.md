## Why OpenWebF?

**Build Fast. Ship Fast. Run Fast.**

OpenWebF is the compact browser runtime that brings web development's speed and flexibility directly to Flutter. Our high-performance web rendering engine seamlessly glues Web, Flutter, and Native platforms together, enabling you to:

- **Build Fast:** Dev with React or Vue + TailwindCSS, build with Vite, and deploy to Vercel - it all just works in WebF
- **Ship Fast:** Deploy once across all Flutter-supported platforms from a single codebase  
- **Run Fast:** Experience native-level performance that outpaces traditional WebView solutions

## Key Features

OpenWebF is a high-performance, cutting-edge web rendering engine built on top of Flutter, empowering web applications to operate natively within the Flutter ecosystem.

âœ… **Dedicated Rendering Architecture** - We solved browser engine bottlenecks - the magic that brings your React/Vue UI's LCP times to less than 100ms  
âœ… **DOM, Window, Document, CSS Selectors** - `document.querySelector()`, `window.localStorage`, `element.addEventListener()`, `MutationObserver`, `querySelectorAll()` - hundreds of web APIs just work  
âœ… **Core CSS Support** - Standard CSS Box Model, CSS inline formatting context, CSS Flexbox, Animations - these features make TailwindCSS just work in WebF  
âœ… **Framework Ready** - Your existing React hooks, Vue components, and npm packages work without modification  
âœ… **Modern Build Tools Support** - Vite and Webpack builds just work in WebF - HMR, tree-shaking, code splitting all supported  
âœ… **Popular Web Stack Ready** - Vercel, React, Next.js - the most popular web development workflows are ready for developing Flutter apps  
âœ… **Flutter Widget Integration** - Use Flutter's built-in UI libraries like Cupertino and Material widgets as components in your React/Vue apps  
âœ… **Flutter Economy Access** - Just tell us which feature you want, the highway is ready to connect to any Flutter plugins - [thousands available](https://fluttergems.dev/)  
âœ… **Core DevTools Support** - Element panel inspection and network debugging with Chrome DevTools  
âœ… **True Cross-Platform** - Same codebase runs on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux (web browser support coming soon)



## How it works

WebF is a **compact browser runtime** that brings the full power of web development directly into Flutter. Unlike heavy WebView solutions, WebF provides a lightweight, high-performance rendering engine that follows W3C standards while being deeply integrated with Flutter's rendering pipeline.

**The Magic:** Web Apps and Flutter Apps share the same rendering context. This means you can seamlessly blend Flutter widgets with HTML elements, creating a unified development experience where web technologies just work natively in Flutter.

## Performance Benefits

ðŸš€ **Native Speed** - No WebView overhead, runs directly on Flutter's rendering pipeline  
âš¡ **Fast Startup** - Lightweight runtime loads instantly compared to heavy browser engines  
ðŸŽ¯ **Optimized Memory** - Efficient resource usage with shared rendering context  
ðŸ“± **Smooth Animations** - 60fps performance across all platforms
